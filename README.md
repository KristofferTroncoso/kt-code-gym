# KT Code Gym

This repo is meant to be a personal monorepo to contain mini practice projects and drills. It's best to keep them in one repo instead of flooding my Github page with dozens of repos of practice todo-apps.

Apps and drills:
* todo-app
* simple-site
* coding-challenges

Every once-in-a-while I can take an hour to drill these practice apps using technology I haven't used in a while or technology I've never used before.

What else is good to drill every now and then?
