# KT Code Gym ðŸ¥‹

This repo is meant to be a personal monorepo to contain mini practice projects and drills. It's best to keep them in one repo instead of flooding my Github page with dozens of repos of practice todo-apps.

Apps and drills:
* todo-app mvc for crud and logic
* simple-sites for UI and routing
* coding-challenges for programming language proficiency
* starter kits and templates for tooling comprehension

Every once-in-a-while I can take an hour to drill these practice apps using technology I haven't used in a while or technology I've never used before.

Will include everything from programming languages, frameworks, libraries, methodologies, tools, and more.
