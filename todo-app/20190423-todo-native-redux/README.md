# redux todo app with React Native

* Reused my redux code from the redux todo app i made for the web
* Didn't have to write the logic for this drill. Instead just focused on rewriting the UI components.
* In a more integrated project, I can perhaps have a monorepo containing the redux code shared between the React Native project and React (web)
