# Todo april

* I forked this from the todo app i made around November 2018.
* Im refactoring to try to make as much of the code reusable. 
* More specifically I want to try to use most of the code for React Native
* Therefore I'd have to separate the UI/rendering components from the logic
* I can either use HOCs and/or 'render props' and/or hooks.
* Im trying to do everything without hooks for now but i do know hooks is the way moving forward.
